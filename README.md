# week-02-assignment

Reflection
Despite being eager to build on the skills learnt and practised from the previous assignment, I was also aware that this project would require more attention to detail and better understanding of structuring a webpage properly.

Reading through the brief, I was slightly confident to meet the basic requirements of the task however, on seeing the stretch requirements of . However, as I started working on the project, I realized that breaking it down into smaller components made it more manageable. By approaching each section individually—the navigation bar, sections and background images, and footer—I was able to make steady progress and buildconfidence in my ability to use HTML and CSS effectively. I experienced challenges in getting the right images to use for the webpage I had in mind, as what I initially pictured was not the outcome I got from the image and colour combinations I tried. This made me ponder on the kind of skills required for website design-do software developers need to have design skills as well?

On the requirements achieved, I successfully created a navigation bar that allowed users to move between sections smoothly. I also incorporated background images as required and ensured that the website had a structured layout with clear divisions for the header, main content, and footer. As a stretch goal, I embedded an audio file, which was achieved by watching Youtube videos on how to add audio files to HTML code. I attempted some of the stretch requirements that required the use of Java Script however, I was unable to get the outcomes I was hoping for, and ended up up taking them out of my work--a reminder to work on my Java Script skills.

Another challenge I encountered was ensuring that the background images displayed correctly on the screen. Most, of the images I used were mostly too small to align with the section content. To resolve this, I experimented with different background-size and background-position properties to eventually get my images to fit on my page in a visually appealing way.

Throughout the assignment, I found that trial and error played a significant role in my learning process. Testing different CSS properties, HTML tags, making small adjustments, and seeing the effects immediately helped me understand the whys behind some code inputs. I also built knowledge from session recordings as well as external resources such as YouTube, W3Schools and MDN Web Docs.

Overall, this assignment made me think more critically about web design and I intend to further refine my knowledge of HTML tags and references, CSS positioning, Java Script, and best practices in embedding media elements, as I believe these skills will be essential for future projects.
